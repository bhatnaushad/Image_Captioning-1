# Image_Captioning
Image Captioning project for "Computer Vision Expert" Udacity Nanodegree Program

## Project Overview
Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image.
In this project, I have implemented a Deep Learning Model inspired by *Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator*.

The project will be broken up into three Python notebooks; the first two are for exploration of provided code, and a review of SLAM architectures:

__Notebook 0__ : Dataset

__Notebook 1__ : Preliminaries

__Notebook 2__ : Training

__Notebook 3__ : Inference
